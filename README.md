# A repository for CartographCF normal fonts and nerd fonts.

As a greedy and lazy developer, I want to have a curly and readably font for night-work aesthetics. Then I came across this font. There maybe some change and this repository might move somewhere else, until then, enjoy!


## Installation.
- ### Windows
- ### Linux
    Make sure to clone this repository first. 
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SvnFrs/cartograph-fonts.git

    ```
    Then **cd** into the cloned folder
    ```
    cd cartograph-fonts
    ``` 
    Then **cp** those folders into the local user directory
    ```
    cp nerd-fonts normal-fonts ~/.local/share/fonts/        
    ```
    Then reload the fonts cache by running
    ```
    sudo fc-cache -vf
    ```
I recommend you also reboot the system too.
